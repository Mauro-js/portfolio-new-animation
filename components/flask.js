    return(<p>Flask is a Python web framework that allows developers to quickly and easily create web applications. Flask is considered a micro-framework, which means that it is designed to be lightweight and flexible, and does not include unnecessary additional components. Flask provides the basic tools for creating web applications, such as URL routing, cookie management, support for Jinja2 templates, and more. Although Flask is considered a beginner-level framework, it is highly scalable and extensible, and is used by developers of all levels of experience to create web applications from simple to complex.
